# Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification (Keras + Notebook)

Small, self-contained project that trains and evaluates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify **Pneumonia vs Normal** cases from chest X-ray images.

The project uses the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset and is implemented in **Keras (TensorFlow backend)** with a fully reproducible **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- CNN-based classification models
- Training and validation with performance metrics

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset  

## Note
