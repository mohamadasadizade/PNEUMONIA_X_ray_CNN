# Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification (Keras + Notebook)

Small, self-contained project that trains and evaluates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify **Pneumonia vs Normal** cases from chest X-ray images.

The project uses the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset and is implemented in **Keras (TensorFlow backend)** with a fully reproducible **Jupyter Notebook**.

**Run in the Google Colab:**
